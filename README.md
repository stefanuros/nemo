# Nemo

Nemo is a toy browser engine based on [this](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html) 
tutorial as well as [this](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork) article. It was made so that I could get a better understanding of how other 
browser engines worked. It's named after the famous fictional explorer Captain Nemo
from Jules Vernes books "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" as well as 
"The Mysterious Island".
